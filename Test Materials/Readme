- Only IDs from the `Allowed_IDs` database will be approved for leave requests.  
- Unauthorized IDs receive immediate rejection.

- **Name** and **Emirate ID** fields auto-populate using OCR technology.  
- Manual input is disabled to ensure data integrity.  

‚úÖ **Error Handling**  
- Failed data extraction triggers:  
  
  ‚ùå Error: Name/ID extraction failed. Please reupload a clear document.  
    
Blurry, expired, or damaged documents are rejected instantly.
